Procedure of running FTT-Tr:
1. Run FTTTr53x25v3Gui.m and the GUI will pop up.
2. In the GUI, load the assumption spreadsheet [example: Assump_FTT-Tr-59_2022 in https://zenodo.org/records/11078586]
3. Click "calculate scenario" and the scenarios will be calculated.
4. After the scenario is calculated, yellow shaded rectangle will show up next to the scenarios.If there is a green rectangle, the model has not been running successfully and pls do check the errors in Matlab.
5. The main variables we often check are S (fleet shares), G (total service demand by technology), J is energy use and E is emissions.
6. Click the country of interest. Pls note that if you would like to check the result of a region, choose the name of the region instead of summing the countries together. For example, if you would like to take a look at Europe as a whole, choose number 51 Europe (all).
